# frog-body-size-evolution
 
This repository contains the R code and data necessary to conduct various phylogenetic comparative analyses on body size evolution from:

Portik, D.M., Blackburn, D.C., and J.A. McGuire. 2020. Macroevolutionary patterns of sexual size dimorphism among African tree frogs (Family: Hyperoliidae). Journal of Heredity, Online Early. https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esaa019

The paper is provided as a PDF in this repository, but can also be found on the publisher's website here.

The R-script Phylogenetic_comparative_analyses.R uses data available in the data folder. To use the R script, you will need to edit the paths to the various files.
